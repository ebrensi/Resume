Hello Signifyd!  I am inquiring about a Back-end Software Engineer position (Sheriff?) that I saw on StackOverflow while searching for tips on a problem I was facing with a Python project.  

What caught my eye was: 
"Our engineers build systems that catch bad guys.  Using all available payment, user, and machine data, we have to separate legitimate credit card transactions from fraudulent in under 400ms."

This sounds really intriguing to me!
 
I am relatively new to the job market but I'm sure I have more than sufficient coding skills for the position.  I have a M.S. in applied math from UC Davis, and a few projects under my belt; some open source at https://github.com/ebrensi, and a current private one that I can discuss with you.  I completed all five levels of the Google foobar challenge recently as well.  I primarily work in Python at the moment, and I've been involved in the SF Bay Area Python community for the last year. Python has been my development language of choice since I graduated a couple of years ago.  I can do a little javascript too.  Most recently I've been getting familiar with the Scrapy web scraping framework for Python, and Heroku for a cloud based app I'm developing.  
 Before I got into Python I did most of my thesis work in Matlab, but I have been writing code on and off since I was a kid.  I can do low-level coding in C.  I think most importantly though, I have built-in analytical problem solving skills from years of researching and teaching math.  I have some experience with SQL, although most of my data manipulation work has used Python with Pandas.  I am familiar with the standard operations for querying and joining tables, and I've done a bit of data-munging and cleaning.

I think I can be an asset to Signifyd.  I'm really curious about the problem(s) you are working on there and how I could help, and I'd love to talk with someone there about it.  Cheers!
