Hello Uber! This is the cover letter accompanying my application for the "Back End Software Engineer - Driver" postion in San Francisco.

I'm looking for entry level software development work.  I have a math background and more recently I picked up full-stack development through my own projects.

Here's my story:  I graduated from UC Davis with a M.S. in Applied Mathematics two years ago.  I left the math PhD program All-But-Dissertation after 8 years; my field of study was computational linear algebra, and I developed a model reduction algorithm based on Krylov subspace methods, used in simulation for large-scale integrated circuits.  My grad school experience was isolating.  I didn't have much communication with my adviser and I didn't socialize much with people in the math department.  I left that experience really lonely, lost and depressed.  After graduating I moved in with my parents in Oakland, and for the last two years I have been figuring out what I want to do with my life and catching up on social skills.  I've mostly taken on volunteer work, some of which involved software development.  It took a while but I feel ready to enter the professional workforce now.
