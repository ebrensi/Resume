\employer{Center on Youth Registration Reform}{6/2015-12/2015}{Web Scraping, data-analysis}
 Provided preliminary data to CYRR for working towards reforming sex-offender legislation as it applies to juveniles.
\begin{achievements}
\item Wrote a web-scraper using Python Scrapy framework with a central spider class and 20 sub-spiders to scrape public Sex-Offender registries for 20 states.  Data stored in PostgreSQL via SQLAlchemy.
\item Identified offenders on the registry who were convicted as juveniles.
\item Scraping jobs controled via scrapyd REST API (\url{https://registry-backend.herokuapp.com}) 
\item A minimal (Python Flask) front-end is viewable at \url{https://registry-frontend.herokuapp.com}

\employer{Impact Hub Oakland co-working space}{3/2015 - 2/2016}{Business Intelligence}
Parsed Excel spreadsheets \& Google Calendar, presented aggregate data
\begin{achievements}
\item Wrote Python scripts to parse and summarize venue rental invoices.
\item Used entry/exit data from IHO's card swipe hardware to analyze space usage for individual members and groups, providing IHO management with information about member habits.
\item Used invoice records and calendar entries to create a summary of space rental/usage.
\end{achievements}



\employer{Research in Industrial Projects for Students (RIPS) at UCLA}{6/2006-8/2006}{Algorithm development, Documentation, Programming}
Team leader for Image-based-spam detection proof-of-concept project at  Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics (IPAM), sponsored by Symantec Inc.
	\begin{achievements}

\end{achievements}

\employer{Code for America (Open Oakland Brigade)}{8/2015-12/2015}{Software Development}
I briefly worked with California Civic Lab, a project to extend Oakland's successful open-disclosure project to other California city and County governments.  This got me motivated to do web-development.
\begin{achievements}
\item Gained familiarity with group collaboration via GitHub, creating and fixing issues, making pull requests, etc.
\item Got familiar with Django app development and working in a team environment
\end{achievements}

\school{University of California, Davis}{Davis, CA, U.S.A.}{M.S. Applied Mathematics, 2006-2014}

My research focus was computational linear algebra.
\begin{achievements}
\item Developed a new thick-restarted Krylov-subspace method for MIMO model order-reduction.
\item Introduced a new orthogonalization process for complex-valued Krylov subspace basis vectors that cuts computational costs in half by treating complex vectors as long real-valued vectors.
\item Wrote a suite of Matlab scripts for proof-of-concept implementation and analysis of the method.
\item  Produced novel transfer-function gain plots that make pole-zero analysis intuitive.
\item Worked as a Teaching Assistant for several college-level mathematics courses.
\end{achievements}
